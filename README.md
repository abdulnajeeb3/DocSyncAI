# DocSync AI

DocSync AI is an AI-powered tool that helps keep your project documentation up-to-date with the latest changes in your codebase. By leveraging static code analysis and vector databases, DocSync AI identifies changes in your code and suggests updates to your documentation.

## Features

- Clones a public GitHub repository
- Detects changes between the latest and previous commits
- Performs static analysis to find changed functions
- Generates embeddings for functions and documentation
- Identifies and updates relevant sections in the README.md file

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/DocSync_AI.git
   cd DocSync_AI
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Update the Pinecone API key in `config/pinecone_config.py` with your own key:
   ```python
   # config/pinecone_config.py
   PINECONE_API_KEY = 'your-pinecone-api-key'
   ```

2. Run the main script with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to analyze:
   ```sh
   python src/main.py
   ```

3. The script will output the areas in the `README.md` that need changes based on the detected changes in the code.
